So I generally made goals based on the financial year for my agency, since the first 6 months turn into growth and the last are either maintenance or a sprint in the past.

In 2022, things were a bit different. I took on a large project for a nutrition start up, as well as a number of smaller projects that helped me grow.

Though it hasnt come without it's stresses (I was pretty sick in December and Start of Jan 2023); but I have learnt a tonne more on time management and balance. 
I look over at how I ran the last 6 months, and I then see how I want to run the next 6 until tax time.

With that said, I do need to seperate work and timeoff better, but overall there isnt alot I would change, albiet a few focus points for the next 6 months
